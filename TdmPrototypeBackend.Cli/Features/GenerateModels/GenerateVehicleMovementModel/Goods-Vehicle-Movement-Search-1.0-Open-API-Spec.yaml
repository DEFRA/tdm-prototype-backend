                  does not require a customs inspection.  If not set, indicates the
                  customs inspection decision has not yet been made or is not applicable.  For
                  outbound GMRs, this indicates that the vehicle must present at an
                  inspection facility prior to checking-in at the port.  For Office
                  of Transit inspections for inbound GMRs, a decision may be made
                  to inspect subsequent to a notification that inspection is not required.  In
                  this event a notification will be sent that changes inspectionRequired
                  from false to true.  If this happens after leaving the port of arrival,
                  the inspection should be carried out at the next transit office
                  e.g. the office of destination.
